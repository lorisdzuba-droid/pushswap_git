_this project has been created as part
of the 42 curriculum by ldzuba_

this project takes any number of number as a series of interger or a single argument "string" that only contain valide integers. it will use the radix algorithm to sort those number from lowest to biggest and print the opperations "sa sb ss pa pb ra rb rr rra rrb rrr" used to organise the numbers

to compile use <make> then ./push_swap <numbers>

the resources where varied since it is a school project diffrents git repository and wikis of algorithms where consulted to familiarise myself with them and https://brilliant.org/wiki/radix-sort/ was the main source of information on the subject.
